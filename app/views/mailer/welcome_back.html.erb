Hey <%=@person.first_name%>,<br>
<br>
Bountysource is back! We're relaunching and I want to give you a sneak peek.  We now support projects on GitHub and we'll soon be adding support for Google Code, SourceForge, Bugzilla, Trac, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We now have two main features:<br>
<ol>
  <li>Bounties let users show support for features they want added to any project they use.</li>
  <li>Fundraisers let developers describe a future project or feature and set a financial goal.</li>
</ol>
We're offering a $5 "Welcome Back" credit to the first 250 people that come back. Just sign in at <a href="<%= "#{Api::Application.config.www_url}#?utm=#{@utm}" %>">www.bountysource.com</a>!<br>
<br>
Also, <b>we love feedback</b> so please <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">email the team</a> or chat with us in #bountysource on Freenode IRC.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
<br>

Hey <%=@person.first_name%>,

Bountysource is back!  We're relaunching and I want to give you a sneak peek.  We now support projects on GitHub and we'll soon be adding support for Google Code, SourceForge, Bugzilla, Trac, etc.

We now have two main features:

1. Bounties let users show support for features they want added to any project they use.
2. Fundraisers let developers describe a future project or feature and set a financial goal.

We're offering a $5 "Welcome Back" credit to the first 250 people that come back.  Just sign in at: <%= Api::Application.config.www_url %>#?utm=<%=@utm%>

Also, *we love feedback* so please email the team support@bountysource.com or chat with us in #bountysource on Freenode IRC.

Thanks!

-Warren
